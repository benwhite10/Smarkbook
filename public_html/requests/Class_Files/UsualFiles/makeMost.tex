\noindent Your learning will happen in two separate ways. First, you will learn by tackling unfamiliar questions. By applying techniques you know to a new scenario, or with slightly more algebraic complication, your understanding will develop incrementally. You will also learn in class, from your classmates, as they explain the solutions they have developed. You might see a new way of solving a problem that you hadn't thought of. Assimilating this technique into your toolkit may help you solve new problems in the future.
